This repository contains some notebooks made from kaggle competitions on several 
datasets.

******************************************************************
A journey on CNN (VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2 and transfer learning)
******************************************************************

The goal was to classify flower images among 5 species. We use transfer learning 
with the MobileNetV2 model and demonstrates the efficiency of fine tuning.

*************************************************************************
Using regression, XGBoosting and neural network to predict house prices
*************************************************************************

With 79 explanatory variables describing several aspects of residential homes, we use advanced regression techniques like random forest, gradient boosting but also multi-layer perceptron to predict the final house of each home.
