###  [Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/outinim/kaggle_notebooks/tree/master/houses_regression)
[Github](https://github.com/outinim/kaggle_notebooks/blob/master/houses_regression/house_price.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/outinim/kaggle_notebooks/blob/master/houses_regression/house_price.ipynb)

With 79 explanatory variables describing several aspects of residential homes, we use advanced regression techniques like random forest, gradient boosting but also multi-layer perceptron to predict the final house of each home.

* Participation of the kaggle competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/)
* I used a weighted average of Lasso, ElasticNet, Ridge, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Regressor
* The focus of this project was mostly on feature engineering and machine learning models (hyperparameters tuning)

###  [Flowers Recognition](https://github.com/outinim/kaggle_notebooks/tree/master/flower_recognition)
[Github](https://github.com/outinim/kaggle_notebooks/blob/master/flower_recognition/cnn_mobilenetv2.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/outinim/kaggle_notebooks/blob/master/flower_recognition/cnn_mobilenetv2.ipynb)

The goal was to classify flower images among 5 species. We use transfer learning 
with the MobileNetV2 model and demonstrates the efficiency of fine tuning.

* Project for the course Machine Learning
* Participation on the dataset [Flowers Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)
* The focus of this project was mostly computer vision (deep learning, transfer learning)

###  [Bike Sharing Demand](https://github.com/outinim/kaggle_notebooks/tree/master/bike_hours)
[Github](https://github.com/outinim/kaggle_notebooks/blob/master/bike_hours/predictions.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/outinim/kaggle_notebooks/blob/master/bike_hours/predictions.ipynb)

The goal was to classify flower images among 5 species. We use transfer learning 
with the MobileNetV2 model and demonstrates the efficiency of fine tuning.

* Project for the course Machine Learning
* Participation on the competition [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)
* The focus of this project was mostly data vizualisationn and machine learning applied to time series
